* We need some content for the user to read

    * We could put the button at the bottom of the content
* Some element to put the results text into


### JS

    * Asks the user's name
    * Confirm that the user is ready to take the quiz
    * Three yes/no questions about the content
    * Alert that the quiz is complete and that the results will now be displayed
    * Display a response on the page that gives user's name, results out of 3
    * STRETCH: include in this display a whole number percentage and some message about the user's performance
