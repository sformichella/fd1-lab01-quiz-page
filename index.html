            <h2>Euclid</h2>

                <p>
                    Eulcid was a Greek mathematician that is well-known for writing the <span class="italics">Elements</span>, a collection of books that detail subjects such as geometry and number theory. Did you know that he also provided a famous proof of the fact that there are infinitely-many prime numbers?
                </p>

            <h3></h3>  

                <p>
                    Recall that a prime number cannot be evenly divided by any positive number except 1 and the prime itself. Prime numbers are of supreme importantance because of the <span class="italics">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</span>, which states that every positive integer can be written uniquely (up to order, since multiplication is commutative) as a product of prime numbers. For example, the number 105 can be written as a product of 3, 5, and 7, and the only way to write 105 as a product of prime numbers is to use exactly one 3, exactly one 5, and exactly one 7.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Euclid's proof uses the strategy <span class="italics">proof by contradiction</span>. It goes like this:
                    
                        <ol>

                            <li>Assume the opposite of what you want to be true.</li>
                            <li>Bring into existence some object like a number or algebraic expression.</li>
                            <li>Use this object to arrive at logical impossibility, like 1 equals 2.</li>

                        </ol>
                </p>
                    
                <p>
                    In his proof, we assume that there are only a finite number of primes. Then we define a carefully chosen number and use it to find a logical impossibility! Proof by contradiction is an extremely useful strategy. We can use it to prove lots of things including the following facts:

                    <ul>

                        <li>The square root of 2 is irrational.</li>
                        <li>The square root of any non-square number is irrational.</li>
                        <li>The shortest path between two points is a straight line.</li>

                    </ul>

                    
                </p>
