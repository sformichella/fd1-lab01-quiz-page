            <h2>The Infinitude of Prime Numbers</h2>

            <p>
                Eulcid was Greek mathematician that is well-known for writing the <span class="italics">Elements</span>, a collection of books that detail subjects such as geometry and number theory. Did you know that he also provided a famous proof of the fact that there are infinitely-many prime numbers?
            </p>

            <p>
                Recall that a prime number cannot be evenly divided by any positive number except 1 and the prime itself. Prime numbers are of supreme importantance because of the <span class="italics">Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic</span>, which states that every positive integer can be written uniquely (up to order, since multiplication is commutative) as a product of prime numbers. For example, the number 105 can be written as a product of 3, 5, and 7, and the only way to write 105 as a product of prime numbers is to use exactly one 3, exactly one 5, and exactly one 7.
            </p>

            <p>
                Euclid's proof use the strategy <span class="italics">proof by contradiction</span>. It goes like this: assume the opposite of what you want to be true and demonstrate that this assumptions leads in one way or another to a logical contradiction. In his proof, we assume that there are only a finite number of primes. Then we define a carefully chosen number and use it to find a logical impossibility!
